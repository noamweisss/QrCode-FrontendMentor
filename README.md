## Overview
This is an interesting challenge to start with - sipmle enough for my level, but not trivial. I didn't have to learn anything new from scratch, but I did have to sharpen my existing skills in HTML and CSS and be a lot more aware of my code decisions than I was used to. Itws a simle card with an image and a text, but I learned so much just by doing an actual project, for example - how to use Git and Github.

### What I learned

The most important thing I learned was how to center a div in the body. Sounds trivial, but it realy was the most difficult thing in this project. eventuallt this is how i did it: 

```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [How to center a div](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
